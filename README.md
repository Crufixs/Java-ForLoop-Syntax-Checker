# Java-Syntax-Checker

This program is used to check whether the synatx of a java "For loop" is correct using context-free language. It does so by taking an input string and checking if the string belongs to the hard-coded grammar within the program. The grammar contains the syntax rules of a for loop but could be made to adjust for different syntaxes as well by hard-coding the grammar changes within the program.
